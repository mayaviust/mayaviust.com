                    <h2>Hey there!</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm an Atlanta based programmer and currently an undergraduate
                        junior in computer science at Georgia Tech. Officially, my degree
                        concentrations are
                        <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/content/people" target="_blank">
                            People</a> and
                        <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/information-internetworks" target="_blank">
                            Information Internetworks</a>
                        which means that I focus on human-computer interaction and
                        information processing/storage/security.
                        <br><br>
                        Most of my experience is in front-end development but as my
                        studies involve more back-end technology, I look for ways to
                        further my knowledge and skills outside of class.
                        <br><br>
                        As of early 2018, I'm applying for internships for Summer 2018.
